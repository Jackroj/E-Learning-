        An HTML5 application project is a web application that is displayed in a browser on your desktop or a mobile device. An HTML5 application is typically comprised of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. The JavaScript that is used to manipulate and process objects in the application is generally handled on the client side by the JavaScript engine in the web browser. An HTML5 application is often used as a client that consumes various web services.

        The IDE provides wizards for creating HTML5 projects and the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that HTML5 projects typically contain. When you use the New Project wizard to create an HTML5 project you have the option to create the project based on a site template. In the wizard you can specify a site template that is located on your local system or download one of the listed site templates from an online repository.

        An HTML5 application project is typically run in a browser on your desktop or a mobile device. When you run an HTML5 application on your local system for testing or debugging you do not need to compile or deploy the application to a server because the JavaScript engine in the browser generally handles any scripts in the application. To run the application you only need to specify the browser and then run the application.

        A NetBeans extension is available for the Chrome browser that enables the IDE and the browser to communicate. To integrate the IDE with the Chrome browser you need to install the NetBeans Connector extension from the Chrome Web Store or install the extension manually. After you install the extension you can perform the following tasks in the Chrome browser.

        You can use the Inspect mode to help you locate and edit the source code in an HTML5 application. When Inspect mode is enabled, information about some of the actions that you perform in the browser such as selecting and highlighting elements is communicated to the IDE. When you run the application you can use your browser to help you locate HTML elements in your source code. When you select or place your cursor over elements in the browser window the element is simultaneously highlighted or selected in the Navigator window of the IDE. When you select an element the style rules for the element are automatically displayed in the Selection tab of the CSS Styles window.
